ABSTRACT: Our goal is to identify and analyze the characteristics of Computational Thinking for mathematical students training alongthe production of digital games and robotic devicesfor the treatment of Parkinson's disease symptoms. Guided by the qualitative research methodology, data production was carried out with high school students from IF-Goiano, in Ipameri, and at the Hospital Dia do Idoso, in Anápolis. The formative research scenario was created as a place to feel mathematics experiences as a way of life and not as mechanical action and formalisms, which tend to undermine the student s own way of thinking and inventing in relation to the mathematical and computational knowledge mobilized. In place of definition-example-exercises-Answers, we value understanding-invention-results of mathematics and its technologies. The procedural hierarchy content-example-exercises is broken in this conception, giving rise to Parkinson s research and scientific-Technological invention. The data produced were analyzed from elements of Computational Thinking mobilized during the production of the game and the robotic device. The results obtained indicate characteristics of Computational Thinking that are integrated into mathematics training: Algorithm, pattern recognition, decomposition and abstraction, based on scientific-Technological inventions for the treatment and well-being of affected patients. © 2021 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

ABSTRACT: Computational thinking is an emerging form of literacy that seeks to foster the learning of programming in a progressive manner using basic principles of computer coding. This study assessed the computational thinking of 164 undergraduate students in early childhood and elementary education teaching degrees. Differences according to gender and previous experience in robotic programming were examined. For this purpose, the Test of Computational Thinking (TPC) was used. The results reveal that males obtained better results and that previous programming experience influenced the level of development of computational thinking. In addition, three student profiles were identified through a cluster analysis. Females with prior experience in robotic programming and the use of programming languages showed the best results on the TPC. These findings highlight the importance of performing diagnostic evaluations to know the level of competence of students in this area, as it can help identify areas for improvement and adapt training actions according to the needs of each group of students. © 2024 Universidad de Sevilla.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this work is to analyze different programming environments for beginning students that facilitate the development of computational thinking skills, program creation and transition to a text-based programming language. A quasi-experimental methodological design was used, since it did not work with a control group. A mixed exploratory investigation was carried out. The study group consisted of 34 first-year students from the Professional School of Education of the National University of San Agustin de Arequipa. The results show that teaching with block-based programming environments facilitates the understanding of programming concepts. Code.org and turtle with Python were the most preferred tools for learning programming, making them suitable for transitioning to a textual programming language. The programming environments used allowed the development of skills related to computational thinking. © 2021, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Education 4.0 and its applications such as web-based virtual reality (WebVR) can be useful to strengthen student learning, as the use of this technology in teaching allows participation in simulated reality scenarios that strengthen interaction and the development of communication and collaboration skills. In this study, both acceptance and the academic performance of 258 students who participated in a learning experience around components of computational thinking were evaluated through the implementation of a knowledge rally that was designed in a three-dimensional virtual world. The study considered an experimental group and a control group. The results indicate that there is a high level of acceptance to adopt virtual scenarios as a space for learning, and that the academic performance of the students showed an improvement when it was generated in the application of simulated reality. However, there are opportunities that need to be resolved to successfully implement these experiences, such as access to computers with high processing capacity and the development of digital skills for both teachers and students. © 2023 Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona.

ABSTRACT: Computational thinking is a competency that benefits problem solving as in computer sciences as in the other disciplines and everyday life. Currently, it is of interest to include computational thinking in the curricula of all educational levels, however, there are shortcomings such as the lack of evaluation tools in real contexts and the nonexistence of application models oriented on each discipline. This essay’s goal is to show the arguments that support these shortcomings. First, we present a discussion about the computational thinking concept. Later, we introduce a common framework used to design evaluations in computer sciences. After, to contextualize the causes of the evaluation’s shortcomings on computational thinking, we compare with a framework used in medicine. The analysis suggests that the shortcomings are caused by the utilization of Bloom’s taxonomy as the framework. © 2021, Universidad del Zulia. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Computational thinking has been introduced in schools to provide skills to survive in the digital world, but without proper attention to the fact that digital media are not just means of economic development, but a new way of thinking that modifies culture, communication and social relationships. We will try to demonstrate, with the help of literature, software development and the results of experimental workshops, first, that computational thinking must include humanities and, secondly, analogic skills and cultural traditions. Thus, this article’s goal is to rethink the computational thinking framework and overcome its limitations considering the cultural context and especially the rescue of cultural identity. To do this we will follow three main lines of thought: a) the discussion of the limits of technocentrism; b) a proper analysis of the characteristics of software; c) the analysis of alternative educational solutions like Turing machines and shape grammars. In the conclusions we will show that laptops, tablets and smartphones are not indispensable and can even jeopardize learning and creativity. © 2020 Scientific Association Icono14.

ABSTRACT: Technology has transformed the social scenario by incorporating strategies, techniques and methods to obtain more significant educational processes. The main initiative promoted is the strengthening of skills and competencies in programming and computational thinking. This article evidences the effect of a training program on educational robotics on the acquisition of computational thinking and programming skills in young children. The research design is quasi-experimental, with pretest and post-test measures, with an experimental and control group. The sample of participants consists of 46 students of the first year of Primary Education, with age between 6 and 7 years, belonging to a Spanish educational centre. Computational thinking is measured through the dimensions: Algorithmic thinking sequences, abstraction-patterns and debugging. The learning activities used in the intervention sessions were an adaptation of the training actions proposed in the robotics study program "TangibleK". The results obtained in this study reveal positive effects concerning the performance achieved by the participants in the activities carried out. This indicates a significant effect on the strengthening of skills linked to computational thinking. The differences found between the pretest and post-test measures of the experimental group are statistically significant and superior to those presented by the control group. In this way, it was concluded that the participants of the training program in robotics and programming obtain a more significant advance in the three dimensions of the computational competence explored. © 2020 Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca.

ABSTRACT: This project proposes a recommendation model for educational content based on the context of a user, which uses a context model that incorporates the role, tasks, programming exercises and their application to the problem of recommendation. The recommendations are made on the basis of the estimate of the difference between the current level of knowledge of a user in front of the skills required in their work context. The experiments developed in the context of the student, show that, using a model of probabilistic reasoning helps to get better recommendations of educational content, according to the missing competences of a student on an issue that needs to learn, which seeks to standardization for recommendation systems. © 2018 Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca.

ABSTRACT: The insertion of computational thinking in elementary education has been valued in modern education. However, most of the teachers are not trained in computing to work with these contents. Some initiatives use unplugged activities due to limited resources in schools. However, we identified that the proposals do not connect the socio-cultural aspects of the public involved and computational thinking. This article assesses the absence of these socio-cultural aspects and proposes an inclusive activity contemplating all these factors. © 2023, Centro de Estudos Educacao e Sociedade - CEDES.

ABSTRACT: Computational Thinking (CT) became established as a line of international research, however, in Latin America there are limited studies that examine its development and integration in elementary and secondary school. The objective of this study was to analyze the integration of CT in elementary and secondary school education in Latin America, based on a systematic literature review of studies published between 2006 and 2020. The results were grouped into two main categories: Conceptualizations of CT and strategies to integrate CT. It was found that conceptualizations are divided into two groups, those related to computer science and others in which CT is understood as a methodological resource. Regarding strategies, it was found that educational robotics and programming in block languages are the most used in the region. © 2021 Universidad de Murcia. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Digital games are becoming more and more a part of our daily lives. After realizing this, several educators have been motivated to use games as teaching and learning tools. In this sense, it is possible to involve teachers and students in the production of their own games, thus contributing both to the development of computational thinking and to acquiring knowledge related to the different disciplines involved in this process. Despite the benefits, the production of games is a complex task that requires knowledge of a specific domain and presents a significant learning curve for students and teachers. The choice of using effective strategies such as Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) practices supported by a Controlled Natural Language (CNL) to promote the production of games in the educational context is decisive and can favor the adoption of game-based learning. This work proposes a strategy for the specification of game design for digital games by students and teachers in the classroom, that can promote the development of computational thinking, as well as reading and writing skills. © 2019 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Technological advancement and the changing global landscape have presented unique challenges and opportunities to education systems around the world. For example, the teaching of programming and computational thinking has been introduced in many curricula, as reflected in the recent educational law, LOMLOE, in Spain. This incorporation implies the preparation of teachers in the methodological, didactic and technological order to face this challenge. Therefore, a scale has been designed and validated to measure the attitudes of Primary Education teachers towards programming, considering it as a resource to develop computational thinking. The methodology used was the Delphi method, with the participation of twelve experts with a high level of expert competence. After a rigorous two-round process, a consensus was reached and the final structure of the scale was established. The scale is composed of 33 items distributed in five dimensions: self-efficacy, perceived social usefulness, relevance of teaching for students, interest and gender perception. According to the panel of experts, the measuring scale is a valid instrument to determine the level of self-efficacy, interest and perception of usefulness and relevance of teachers to programming. © 2024 Universidad de Sevilla.

ABSTRACT: Computational thinking (CT) describes a type of analytical thinking related to computer science and programming. The International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) and the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) have developed a definition to promote the inclusion of CT in education in the US. The goal of this systematic review is to describe the educational programs that teach CT in primary education (age range 6-14 years) published in indexed scientific journals, following the PRISMA guidelines. The search strategy was carried out in the following five databases: Dialnet, Psycinfo, Scopus, PyscNET and ERIC. A total of 40 articles met the inclusion criteria. The most used programing environment were Scratch (55%), unplugged activities (15%) and Code.org (10%). The software found worked several of the core PC competencies as defined by CSTA & ISTE. This systematic review collects and synthesizes for the first time the educational programs that have proven to be useful for working on CT in children aged 6 to 14 years and relates them to the CT standards established by CSTA, contributing to the knowledge of the tools available to use in the educational field. © 2023 Research Group Education and Virtual Learning (GREAV).

ABSTRACT: The objective of the article is to determine which dimensions of computational thinking are related to the dimensions of creative thinking. The methodology is quantitative with a descriptive non-experimental cross-sectional design. Two instruments are used: one that measures computational thinking through the Directions, Loops, Conditionals, and Functions dimensions, and another that measures creative thinking through the Originality, Fluency, Elaboration, and Flexibility dimensions. The sample was made up of N = 275 students from 7 educational institutions in the Diguillin province, Ñuble Region, Chile. The results show that computational and creative thinking are related to each other. The loops and conditional dimensions are significantly related to all the creative thinking dimensions. The creative thinking dimension elaboration is the most influenced by loops and conditionals, followed by fluidity, originality and flexibility. In conclusion, loops and conditionals are the essential dimensions for stimulating the creative thinking dimensions. © 2021 Scientific Association Icono14. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The incorporation of computational thinking in the classroom has been identified as a fundamental strategy that could spread student participation and have an effective impact on learning. Although there are studies done on this subject, we do not find a systematic dissertation that compiles the fundamental practices of Computational Thinking in teacher training. That is why this article presents a systematic review of literature with the objective of summarizing studies on computational thinking for initial teacher training. Initially the search was conducted in five databases of scientific publications, 100 studies published in the last five years were obtained. After a method of analysis of each of them, verify that they match the requirements of the review, obtaining as a result the compilation of the main experiences and practices reported in the process of Computational Thinking for teachers. In addition, the determined systematic review will determine the associated problems, studies on computational thinking, characteristics, methodologies, teaching-learning strategies and trends. This article is an important starting point for future projects that wish to continue contributing to experiences that benefit both students and teachers in this field of Teaching Computational Thinking. © 2020 Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions.

ABSTRACT: This paper presents the results of a project on Computational Thinking education for primary school pupils. During the project – called Computational Thinking for children education – 81 students from a primary school in Italy have been guided to the design and development of computer games through the Microsoft Kodu game development platform. Different activities have been proposed to the pupils with the aim of promoting Computational Thinking abilities and skills. A narrative approach has been adopted throughout the project. Preliminary results of the educational experience highlight as the adoption of narrative learning and physical reproduction of manipulative programming objects provide an affordance for the development of Computational Thinking abilities. Furthermore, constancy during the learning process affects the acquisition of game development skills; finally, the design and implementation of computer games using Kodu have had a significant positive influence on the perception of computer programming. © 2018 Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca.

ABSTRACT: Computational Thinking has gained relevance over the last few years, even becoming a mandatory school subject in many countries, being a research debate in the most varied areas of knowledge. In a post-pandemic scenario, where we were recently forced to change the way we work, learn and teach, the need for new educational solutions, especially on-line solutions, is more evident. Taking such transformations as a reference, this article describes/presents the development of an on-line instrument to stimulate computational thinking in elementary school, through the use of on-line games. The use of ThinkinGame makes it possible to identify the pillars to be worked with the apprentices, after its use, strengthening and enriching the teaching. © 2023, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: In addition to limited funding, one of the limitations of scientific research in developing countries with a small population, such as Costa Rica, is the lack of human resource with the expertise needed to tackle research challenges. This is particularly the case for emerging fields such as Medical Physics. At the University of Costa Rica (UCR), much of the support to research projects comes from undergraduate students. The main challenge for the principal investigators (PI) is to train these undergraduates to be able to develop not only their assigned tasks, but also their critical thinking skills and knowledge of the field, in order to contribute meaningfully to the research. [1] This work presents the experiences of the Computational Medical Physics Laboratory (FIMEC, Laboratorio de Física Médica Computacional) in training undergraduate students (sophomore and up) for advanced scientific research using innovative educational resources and experiences. All research conducted at FIMEC requires knowledge of graduate level topics and methods in Medical Physics, particularly for the development of Monte Carlo simulations of radiation transport. Methods: Incoming students undergo an induction training including the reading of textbook chapters, scientific articles and theses, with topics in basic concepts on radiation physics, statistics, and anatomy fundamentals. Students undergo a series of tutorials on the computer languages to be used as part of their work (C++, Fortran and others). The training activities are organized in a sequence of increasing difficulty by the PI, to allow the gradual development of skills and knowledge in the students according to their research topic. The students meet regularly with the PI to present their progress and discuss their work. Scientific discussions are aided with the use of educational materials, such as wooden blocks, anatomical models, and board games. These educational materials have been selected to help illustrate and discuss topics related to Monte Carlo modeling. The materials are also used in the design of experiments and the discussion of results. All students are given a laboratory book in which to keep their notes from meetings and their individual work. All exiting students are required to provide documentation on their work, including code manuals, usage guides and a summary of their results. Results and discussion: Since this methodology was implemented at FIMEC in early 2019, 9 undergraduate students have been involved with the laboratory. Three of those students have submitted original work to an international peer-reviewed conference during 2019. Two of those abstracts were derived from work started in 2018 and one of the abstracts was proposed by students who started working at FIMEC in 2019. Two new internal research grants were submitted to UCR for 2020 based on the preliminary work of two other students. In all these works the students involved participated actively in the experiment design, development of software, analysis of results and submission process. In our experience, the use of wooden blocks has resulted to be particularly useful in the discussion of simulation geometries and the analysis of results, as it helps convey ideas both from and to the students in a direct and unequivocal fashion. The remaining students are currently at different stages of their initial training. Conclusions: The implementation of a learning environment where students undergo a series of organized learning activities allows undergraduate students to obtain a minimum of necessary knowledge to become active participants in scientific research. The use of educational materials as aids in the discussion of abstract technical concepts and experimental design facilitates the transference of ideas between the PI and the students and provides a way in which students can convey their own ideas. © 2021 American Institute of Physics Inc..

ABSTRACT: In the article, the authors propose technological projects to develop computational thinking following the phases of problem-solving: understanding the problem, elaboration of the plan, execution of the plan and revision of the solution. During the execution of the projects, the students carried out activities, such as the elaboration of algorithms, programming of the Arduino board and sensors from a friendly and playful interface such as the mBlock; as well as the debugging of programs until obtaining the expected results; These activities carried out by the students had an impact on cognitive processes (reasoning, decision making, understanding of the environment, logic, etc.), practices and technological perspectives. It has been shown that there is a causality between computational thinking skills and problem-solving phases in an environment of engineering students who have just entered university. For the analysis of the relationship between computational thinking skills and problem solving, the Pearson correlation statistical test was used through SPSS software. © 2022, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

ABSTRACT: This work addressed the teaching of Computational Thinking for children from 7 to 11 years of elementary school I for the teaching of logical reasoning. From studies on accessibility in games for children aged 7 to 11 years old, with hearing impairment, an inclusive game was developed to support the teaching of computational thinking in the learning of logic. For the development of the game, not only Computational Thinking were studied, but educational games for children with hearing impairment, in addition to web accessibility guidelines. As a result of the research carried out, an inclusive game, FruitSort, was implemented for children with hearing impairment, which addressed the Merge Sort Sorting Algorithm, to support the teaching of Computational Thinking through a playful and inclusive environment.  © 2023 ITMA.

ABSTRACT: Computational Thinking (CT) has been highlighted as a key competence of the 21st century. The literature has pointed to the use of unplugged activities, including board games (BG), as a strategy to promote the development of Computational Thinking. Recently, new modern board games (MBG), referred to as Eurogames, have aroused the interest of researchers who have underlined their unique design and mechanics. To investigate the impact of the use of MBG on CT development, a systematic literature review (SLR) was structured using the PRISMA protocol as a reference. The focus was centred on the analysis of empirical studies based on the use of board games in school settings to promote CT skills. This paper opens with the presentation of several essential concepts, among which CT and Eurogames are included, followed by the results of the SLR, focusing on the analysed articles, the theoretical frameworks supporting the studies, the research contexts and methods, the data collection instruments and the results reported by the authors. Out of 85 articles, 11 studies published between 2011 and 2021 were analysed. The results suggest that game mechanics, typical of Eurogames, reveal the potential to promote CT. However, the use of these resources requires further exploration. © 2022 Fundacion para la Investigacion Social Avanzada. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Although the trajectory of non-formal education is extensive, its pedagogical potential is frequently underestimated and is not considered as an option for the development of life competences. In this way, the power of non-formal education as a field for skills education in a digital society should not be ignored. It is for this reason that this article addresses the development of the Computational Thinking Competency in non-curricular education contexts. To achieve the objectives of the research, a study is proposed subject to a small sample participating in a summer camp. The discussion of the data obtained demonstrates an improvement in the degree of knowledge of the computational contents, both conceptual and procedural, in addition to developing a range of knowledge of the field know how to be thanks to the follow-up of a didactic sequence based on the use of the digital resource Code .org © 2020 GTE-Educational Technology Group, University of the Balearic Islands.

ABSTRACT: Computational Thinking, through robotics or coding experiences, is being included in the school curriculum around the world. It is considered one of the necessary skills for surviving in the 21st century. However, teachers have often not been trained to teach Computational Thinking at school and do not even know exactly what it is. Therefore, we try to understand the concept of Computational Thinking by teachers in training through a mixed methodology, which allows us to detect important knowledge and errors in relation to this concept. However, on the other hand, good initial attitudes toward Computational Thinking are diagnosed, which can allow the specific training received in this field to be transferable to future contexts of teaching practice. © 2018 Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca.

ABSTRACT: Computational thinking encompasses mental processes that facilitate automated solutions to specific problems. Its integration into primary education is grounded in enhancing problem-solving skills and adapting to the digital environment. However, exactly what constitutes effective teacher training and classroom implementation strategies remains ambiguous. These concerns are addressed in this systematic review, highlighting the influence of school practices on shaping educational curricula. This research examines the implementation of computational thinking and teacher training at the primary education level. Initially, 428 studies were identified in Scopus and Web of Science, and these were then narrowed down to 24 empirical studies published between 2006 and 2023 after applying eligibility criteria and quality assessment. The findings indicate that many educators strive to incorporate computational thinking without adequate training. Robot programming prevails as the primary strategy, and there is high demand for training on the subject, but the use of “unplugged” activities is limited. Nevertheless, before computational thinking in primary education is advocated for, further research is warranted, particularly in the early grades. Educational institutions are encouraged to take the lead in designing and evaluating teacher training programs according to a set of guidelines provided. The successful integration of computational thinking into primary education necessitates more robust pedagogical approaches supported by appropriate teacher training. © 2024, Ibero-American Association for Distance Higher Education (AIESAD).

ABSTRACT: In its simplest sense, computational thinking is considered as a series of specific skills that programmers use to do their homework. They are also useful to people in their professional and personal lives, as a way of organizing the resolution of their problems, and of representing the reality that surrounds them. In a more elaborate scheme, this complex of skills constitutes a new literacy - or the most substantial part of it - and an inculturation to deal with a new culture: Digital culture in the knowledge society. We have seen how Bayesian Probability is used in epidemiology models to determine models of data evolution on contagion and deaths in COVID. We have also seen it in natural language processing. We could also see it in many cases in the most varied scientific and process analysis fields. In this way, with the automation of Bayesian methods and the use of probabilistic graphical models, it is possible to identify patterns and anomalies in voluminous data sets in fields. Fields as diverse as linguistic corpus, astronomical maps, adding functionalities to the practice of magnetic resonance imaging, or to the habits of buying with cards, online or smartphones. In this new way of proceeding, big data analysis and Bayesian theory are associated. If we consider that Bayesian thinking (this way of proceeding) as one more element of computational thinking, then, to what has been said on previous occasions, we must now add the idea of generalized computational thinking, which goes beyond education It is no longer about aspects purely associated with professional or vital practice to deal with life and the world of work, but as a preparation for basic research and for a research methodology in almost all disciplines. Thus defined, computational thinking is influencing research in almost all areas, both in the sciences and the humanities. An instruction focused on this component of computational thinking, or including it, at an early stage, in Secondary, would allow to activate these learnings as very valuable and very complex components at a later stage. In professional or research activity, in the training phase, undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, of these professions. Those that train for these activities and professions. © 2021 Universidad de Murcia. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Computational thinking is a new concept which has been adquiring relevance in the last few years. There are some evidences of trainings based on this new concept improving different cognitive abilities. In this paper, it has been used a training based on computational thinking, designed by "aula cultural de pensamiento computacional" and the general foundation of the University of La Laguna. This training was applied to 49 students of secondary obligatory education who had been divided into two groups: one group received the training with a methodology based in guide learning and the other group received the training based on selflearning methodology. The main objective of this paper is to prove that training can improve the measures of working memory and check if the participants who have a high level of working memory take more benefits of the training. The results show that the training based on non-specific methodology in computational thinking improved the measures of working memory. In addition, there was no evidence of a higher level of benefit of the training in most of the tasks in the participants who have a high working memory level. © 2020 Universidad de Murcia.

ABSTRACT: In this article, we identify and understand the characteristics of a mathematics educational context in which students produce digital games and robotic devices to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Using a qualitative research methodology, we interact with high school students who aimto build an electronic game with a robotic device called Parachute, intended for physiotherapy sessions for patients with Parkinson's. Beyond the walls of the Mathematics classroom, students were encouraged to propose and develop ideas in an instructional environment created for experimentation with digital inventions for the benefit of people. We analyzed data using the theoretical assumptions of computational thinking and critical mathematics. The analytic categories consisted of discussion-analysis of scientific-technological, collaborative-argumentative, and inventive-creative development of technologies. As a result, we identified the following characteristics of the mathematical educational context: formative independence, unpredictability of responses, learning centered on understanding -research-invention, and connection between areas of knowledge. These characteristics originate and develop mutually, dynamically, and idiosyncratically in students' planning, dialogue, and initiative. Moreover, these characteristics foster the exploration of open and unprecedented mathematical problems and decentralize the excessive formalization of the rigor of mathematical objects. © 2022 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study is to approximate the classification process in libraries with computational thinking, a theoretical aspect present in computer science and, more recently, in other fields of knowledge such as information science. The study’s goal is to present an algorithm for precisely and computationally classifying works of children’s literature. The Content Analysis research method was used to analyze the color classification table in the document Guide for the standardization of Vila Velha school libraries network. Three analytical categories were developed a posteriori using the critical thinking skill. The study’s findings revealed three inaccuracies in the color classification table, namely: mutual coverage in classification; incompatibility in the genus-species relationship; incompatibility with the nature of information thematic representation. An algorithm was presented that allows for the precise and computational classification of works of children’s literature. The study concludes that computational thinking can be a process that organizes library classification activity, ensuring accuracy in information thematic representation due to the logical-computational character amalgamated throughout the process flow. © 2023, Universidad Nacional de la Plata.

ABSTRACT: Nowadays, professionals of the most several areas spend much time on computers, studying and building computational models. Nevertheless, we are not yet teaching our young students that technology can be also used to create new knowledge. Therefore, it is urgently needed to redirect efforts to stimulate computational thinking in schools. This course combines the methodologies of problem-based and digital game-based learning with visual programming techniques in order to stimulate the development of computational thinking in order to use the computer as an instrument to increase human cognitive and operational power.

ABSTRACT: This work presents a free software tool that facilitates the teaching of basic robotics and programming concepts at any educational institution. At the same time, it allows the development of computational thinking skills to be carried out: decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition and algorithmic thinking. This tool allows the design and configuration of a robot through the specification of different types of sensors. After designing the robot, its behaviour can be simulated by means of different challenges proposed to the user. This behaviour is defined through a block-based visual programming language. Blocks allow actions that the robot has to perform based on the information gathered by the different sensors to be defined in order to pass a challenge. © 2020 Universidad de Murcia.

ABSTRACT: There has been an increased determination to introduce coding and computational thinking early in education. So, programming has progressively grown and got an essential focus in European education following international trends. This idea of introducing computer programming into the classroom it’s not recent; it came in 1960 by the investigations of Seymour Papert. The potentialities of teaching children's programming languages as an incubator of powerful ideas started in that decade, but it extended and continues to be used nowadays in a vast way. The programming was used to engage children in new ways of thinking, but much more critical than that, putting the student in a role to think about the thinking process. So with this context in mind, we aim to present a series of important ideas that rule the way that Computational Thinking could be applied inside of the Pre-School classroom. For that, we identify in this research the strategies and methodologies that allow teachers to implement these activities with children. Stating good practices and tools, pointing out some tips and ideas on designing projects in Pre-School Education that will allow the working of the computational thinking with the students of the XXI century. © 2022, AUFOP.

ABSTRACT: Training pre-service teachers in their own Computational Thinking (CT) is essential to build with them the discourse of CT didactics and its inclusion in the classroom with children in early childhood and primary education. This research proposes possible solutions to this challenge and analyses the results of an intervention carried out with 71 students from two different cohorts of 2nd year teacher training students. This intervention is based on the intensive practice of coding using visual blocks through a Scratch project during the first part of a semester course. After analyzing the previous and subsequent levels of CT (pre-experimental strategy) by means of a standardized test for its measurement (CTt), it is confirmed that the intensive training experience allows all future teachers to reach a sufficient level of CT, regardless of their previous experience in programming and their initial level of CT (they all end up learning, either by increasing their level of CT or by improving their efficiency). On the other hand, measuring the learning outcomes in the Scratch project, we see a clear relationship between a high resulting CTt level (POST) and a good performance in the block programming learning task, which is evidence that the Scratch project helps to develop the future teachers’ CT. © 2024, Ibero-American Association for Distance Higher Education (AIESAD).

ABSTRACT: The rapid development of gamification and computational thinking seems to open up new educational horizons by providing new opportunities for students to acquire the basic digital skills needed for their cognitive development. Gamification, on the side, flourishes because it brings about high degree of participants’ engagement in an activity. Accordingly, on the other side, the growing scientific interest in computational thinking centers on the fact that it provides a fruitful field of dialogue in the research community for the development of critical and analytical thinking of students. Hence, this paper aims to synthesize knowledge about gamification and computational thinking for improving education for the benefit of students. Specifically, this paper describes: (a) the theoretical background of gamification in learning and education, (b) relevant studies in literature and their findings, and (c) specific gamified applications of STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics] which have been developed to this subject area. Four databases were searched, and 37 papers were finally selected for this review. The findings from the presented learning theories set the foundation on how students obtain knowledge, and the relevant studies in the field of gamification and computational thinking showed some first positive outcomes stemming some first research attempts which need further examination. Furthermore, it seems that with the right use of game mechanics and elements, well-designed applications of STEM gain students’ interest to learn through gameplay and motivate them to cultivate computational thinking and problem-solving skills. © 2024; Los autores.

ABSTRACT: Several western countries have introduced educational policies to keep up with needs and demands of the digital society. Digital competence frameworks, particularly for the teaching profession, may fit into this context, which also includes the development of computational thinking, a competency construct that many consider necessary for the empowerment of citizens. The analysis of the approach to computational thinking in these references provides information on competences that need to be contextualised in the framing of the concept, to ensure conditions for its integration in the educational environment. This analysis is the aim of this study, focusing on four frameworks guiding teacher education policies: Standards of ICT competence for teachers (UNESCO), Common Framework for Teaching Digital Competence (INTEF, Spain), European framework for the digital competence of educators: DigCompEdu (EU) and ISTE Standards for Educators: A Guide for Teachers and Other Professionals (ISTE, USA). Content analysis was used as methodology. Results show that there is no consensus on the definition of computational thinking, although the frameworks, implicitly or explicitly, recognize the importance of integrating computational thinking in teaching practice. However, there is no evidence of methodological guidelines for the operationalization of digital teaching skills that can ensure the promotion of computational thinking. © 2022 Fundacion para la Investigacion Social Avanzada.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, various actions have been developed in Uruguay to expand Computational Thinking in primary and secondary education. This movement is not new, and is based on the work that Seymour Papert carried out for decades, strongly supported by the Logo language in its different versions. This article makes a tour of the most significant actions developed in the country from 1980 to the present, delving into those that are currently carried out in order to promote the development of Computational Thinking. In particular, preliminary data from a survey of teachers and institutions to find out the activities carried out in our country is presented. In summary, it's based on the Paper's conceptualization (1980) and the difficulties presented for computational development at that time, the evolution of Computational Thinking and the most relevant actions carried out in Uruguay to date are described, trying to show that in this country the projections that Paper originally presented are being achieved. © 2020 Universidad de Murcia.

ABSTRACT: Introduction. National and international educational bodies emphasize the importance of developing teaching-learning strategies in classrooms that standardize the use of Information and Communication Technologies in a globalized world. For this reason, programming and robotics have been introduced in classrooms in Spain from early childhood education to higher education as a means of contributing to computational thinking and other approaches such as the STEAM construct in which the arts and sciences converge. Objective. This paper aims to present a program of musical activities for early childhood education with which to contribute to unplugged computational thinking and the language of programming and its relevance in 3-year-old classrooms. Method. This qualitative study presents a didactic proposal with musical activities to develop computational language. These activities were conducted during the 2021-2022 school year in two 3-year-old classrooms in a school in the Community of Madrid, Spain. The participants were 38 students and the two tutors of these classrooms. These two professionals collected information on the categories analyzed and the children’s evaluation items through participant observation and subsequent recordings. Results. The results show a positive development in literacy in programming and robotics, as well as an improvement in spatial reasoning skills, progress in logical thinking, lower limbs motor control, and oculo-manual dexterity. Conclusions. There exists the need to perform programming and robotics activities in contexts and learning situations in pre-school classrooms for the development of computational thinking and interdisciplinary work in all areas of this stage. © 2023 Universidad Nacional.

ABSTRACT: Computer Literacy is a reality in current educational legislation. Within the STEAM competence approach, music education and the development of Computational Thinking (CT) are located in this discipline. In this work, unplugged musical activities are designed based on the Bebras challenges, and their effectiveness is evaluated in terms of CT development in students. A quasi-experimental study was carried out with pre-post test measures in a group of 220 Primary School students (experimental, N = 170; control, N = 50). The experimental group performed three blocks of unplugged musical activities. Computational Thinking Test using Bebras Problems (Lockwood and Moone, 2018) was used as an instrument. Variables of gender, course, environment and academic ability were taken into account. The results show a significant increase in CT in the experimental group at a general level and in the Bebras activities of medium and advanced levels of difficulty. Schoolchildren from the rural context showed higher scores in CT development compared to the urban one. No significant differences are observed in the rest of the variables. Finally, a higher level of correct answers was observed in "easy" activities, greater completion of "medium" activities and a decrease in both in "advanced" activities. © 2023 Universidad de Murcia.

ABSTRACT: Some children in their first years of school age face different difficulties of an academic nature, mainly in the readiness of the mathematics subject. The dyscalculia is one of them, especially in depressed socio-economic environments. So, the study aimed to design a methodology based on computational thinking to decrease dyscalculia. The main scientific bases are taken from the theory of computational thinking, neuroeducation, constructivism and the use of active methodologies. Using a quasi-experimental design, with the contributions of basic research, the test of the hypothesis that allowed establishing a relationship between computational thinking and mathematical thinking development in elementary school children was made, this is reflected in the results obtained in the posttest that denote a substantial improvement in the basic printed operations, oral dictations, writings with numbers and the operations. © 2022, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

ABSTRACT: In teaching, the importance of consolidating computational thinking (CT) and digital literacy (DL) as two necessary skills to train professionals in the 21st century has been pointed out. However, the scientific production that has interwoven both topics is scarce. The objective of this article was to carry out a systematic review of the literature that analyzes the link between both concepts in the period 2010-2021. The result is an overlapping proposal that addresses abstraction, algorithm design, pattern identification, and decomposition as basic components of CT, and computational concepts, practices, and perspectives as experiential components. Regarding DL, critical, informational and communicative skills were considered. It is concluded that the hypotheses that are established from the model that has been designed here are a contribution that will serve as a frame of reference to discuss the importance of incorporating CT as a higher order digital literacy. © 2022 CSIC.

ABSTRACT: In recent decades, computational thinking had a basic role in education and in the regulatory chain of many countries, also receiving great attention from various international organizations that have expressly requested its promotion starting from school education. The present study analyzes scientific productivity on SCOPUS about computational thinking and its diffusion in schools, with specific reference to the K-12 context. The study has been extended to 2006, when Jeannette Wing published the primary article on computational thinking, starting a body of research and projects on the subject, so that to date, in February 2020, there are 1850 citations of its publication on SCOPUS. The data support a global picture on the evolution of the phenomenon, showing an increase of interest, the main promoting countries, the sources, the authors and the most cited works, allowing a good reference for the scientific research sector on the computational thinking phenomenon in education, a theme that is more relevant and significant today than ever before. The present study also represents a tool for reflection on the need to educate the young people of the twenty-first century to computational thinking with the aim of making them achieve the specific skills that today's work market requires. © 2020 Universidad de Sevilla.

ABSTRACT: Countries in the world have included in their educational agendas the incorporation of Computational Thinking (CT) in Compulsory Education. Despite the efforts of the school authorities, the school systems have difficulties in developing this proposal in the traditional classrooms. In this article we present two experiences based on the use of educational technologies and methodologies that have helped overcome these difficulties by bringing the PC to the Classroom effectively for students, teachers and schools. Experiences have been developed in collaboration with educational institutions and ministries of education in two Latin American countries. The educational technologies used are virtual learning environments (VLE), synchronous collaboration systems, and Scratch / Snap online programming environments. The educational methodologies developed are based on collaborative work teachers-tutors, teachers-students, and students-students. Both educational technologies and methodologies have been used together to develop, through the PC, the ability of our students to solve problems related to daily life and the working world. © 2020 Universidad de Murcia.

ABSTRACT: The main objective of this research is to build a theoretical-practical model that from the existing conceptual contributions allows the generation of computational thinking in high school students through the incorporation of STEM Education (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum. In this sense, STEM education enters to qualify the curriculum and becomes a methodology that gives entry to the understanding of phenomena. Through this research, a model is proposed for the understanding of computational thinking (CT). With and without the use of digital mediation. This article shows the result of a conceptual review of the topics related to the object of study in the last 5 years and the critical analysis of the investigations found. For this reason, it is not a finished project, but rather an advance in the state of the art. © Autor(es); 2023.

ABSTRACT: Current technological progress is helping to promote pedagogical initiatives to transform teaching-learning processes through educational proposals and models that allow the development of significant learning, digital competence and social skills necessary to successfully face the challenges of the twenty-first century. This article presents some of the results generated by the realization of a learning experience on digital skills, associated with computational thinking, using programming challenges and the educational robotics kit Bee-bot®. For the study, a quasi-experimental design was used, with Pretest/ Postest measurements and control group. A total of 40 students and 2 teachers from a concerted school in Salamanca, Spain, participated in the activities during the third quarter of the 2017-2018 academic year. A rubric, a checklist and interviews were used as data collection instruments. The results show the existence of significant differences in favor of the experimental group, in reference to the mastery and learning of computational thinking, through the construction of sequences. In addition, positive social behaviors were observed among students exposed to learning activities and a favorable attitude towards the resource of educational robotics. © 2020 Universidad de Sevilla.

ABSTRACT: One of the causes that leads us to treat Computational Thinking (CT) is that currently educational institutions do not take such thinking into account within the academic curricula and a small percentage of teachers know or have received training on the subject. The main characteristic of Computational Thinking is that it increases the capacities in analysis, design, modeling and programming in stimulated students, especially in those who are in secondary education and are preparing to choose their higher education. This article presents the development of a didactic strategy based on computational thinking and mediated by ICT (Information and Communications Technology) in the teaching-learning process from quantitative reasoning in secondary education. Regarding the methodology, an applied and exploratory type was used, an inquiry is made in the scientific literature on computational thinking and computer tools according to the middle-high school student. © 2023, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

ABSTRACT: The purposes of studies on computational logical thinking foresee that it is possible, through experiment work, to do research on previous skills of logic and mathematics in engineering students, by using packages of software and applications and supporting these students in parallel. It was possible that teachers achieved impact by using co-creation, and, since their work was collaborative, this showed leadership, motivation, and guidance. By using computer programming and analytical tools integrated into the capacities of students, this not only allowed collaboration, but also development and progress for building their own knowledge, in a process according to the pedagogical theory of constructionism. © GKA Ediciones, authors.

ABSTRACT: Educational robotics, programming and computational thinking are being incorporated in the classrooms of many educational centres and at any age. In many cases, this incorporation in the curricula is well-argued and documented, but in other cases, it is done in a rash manner and without prior reflection. In Early Childhood Education, the development of computational thinking seems to have found in floor robots a tool that allows its improvement and progress. To verify if this is so, 50 experts (active teachers, trainers of future teachers and commercial technicians of educational robotics) from all over Spain were tested. The results show that although there is a high percentage of considering floor robots as an excellent tool for the development of computational thinking in Early Childhood Education, there is no consensus when using other types of practices that go beyond and also benefit this learning process. Therefore, we consider it necessary to establish a common framework and guidelines that allow the correct implementation of robotics, programming and computational thinking in Early Childhood Education.

ABSTRACT: Computational Thinking (CT) can amplify learners' skill sets so that they become excellent problem-solvers. Game-Based Learning and Collaborative Learning are two approaches that may aid in the development of CT skills. This paper describes a framework based on Game and Problem-Based Learning Strategies which aims to enhance the CT teaching and improves students' social skills, considering aspects of fun. The framework stands out for including collaborative learning features defined in the main literature. Also, the strategy was developed specifically to fit the games' dynamics. The approach was evaluated via metacognitive and transactive analysis and by a survey. The results showed evidence that the method is able to stimulate interaction among students to apply problem-solving strategies.  © 2020 All right Reserved

ABSTRACT: This article consists of an analysis of how the mathematical competence in problem solving, using the Polya's technique, can be developed using computational thinking with Scratch as a transversal resource, checking how students use Polya's technique while solving arithmetic problems. To know and internalize learning about this problem-solving heuristic, the student has worked previously this kind of thought process with computational thinking using the educational resource. The work has been put into practice using a mixed methodology, accomplishing a time-series experiment with non-substitutive pretest measures. This information has been completed with a qualitative measurement with the student's own perception about their learning process during the development of the empirical experience. To carry out the implementation of this experimental design, the students have done a series of tasks designed with Scratch and developing a project to create a videogame based on solving arithmetic problems. The outcomes show positive results using this methodology and a useful implementation of the computational thinking as a transversal resource in Mathematics, not only improving the mathematical competence but also the linguistic. An important improvement is observed in the reading and comprehension of the statement of the problem, essential process to carry out good resolution of a problematic situation faced by a student using a problem-solving technique. © 2020 Elsevier Doyma.

ABSTRACT: The teaching-learning of programming fundamentals is increasing in secondary schools, however, it is a very difficult task for the teacher because the student has not yet achieved full development of their computational thinking, so they have difficulty in learning programming fundamentals. In this article, we describe the development of computational thinking activities prior to the teaching of programming fundamentals and we analyze the data obtained from a pre- and post-test of computational thinking applied to a control group and an experimental group. Afterwards, we analyze the results obtained from a test of programming fundamentals to both the control group and the experimental group. The activity has been evaluated during the academic year 2017-2018 by 80 high school students from K-10 (15 and 16 years old), our results indicate that the development of activities of Computational Thinking previous to the teaching of programming fundamentals has allowed the students to assimilate in a better way the learning in the mentioned subject, that is to say, they extended their mathematical logical reasoning to develop the respective flow charts without any difficulty. That is, they expanded their mathematical logical reasoning to develop the respective flow diagrams without any difficulty. © 2020 Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, a growing number of countries have introduced computational thinking into the curriculum of compulsory education. In this text, firstly, we briefly analyze some of the problems generated by the absence of a consensus definition of computational thinking and a conceptual framework that guides its integration in the curriculum of the various stages, the relationship with other disciplines and with the digital competence, its evaluation, teacher training, etc. Secondly, some elements of the process followed in Spain to promote its inclusion in the curriculum are described, an example of “fast policy” similar to that of other countries, characterized by temporary compression and the indiscernible fusion of public and private interests. Finally, it is suggested that the discourse on computational thinking in education avoids the debate about how it contributes to the ends of compulsory education and about its previous assumptions and its political and economic implications. © 2019, Ibero-American Association for Distance Higher Education (AIESAD).

ABSTRACT: The present work presents an intervention proposal for the development of computational thinking in early childhood education, through the use of a ground robot with programmed directional controls. Within the use of observational methodology, an observation system has been designed that allows the analysis and interpretation of the behavior displayed in the performance of the intervention proposal. The reliability of the observation system has been guaranteed in the form of inter-observer agreement, calculated using Cohen's (1960) Kappa coefficient. Within the theory of generalizability, the measurement plan [Categories] [Steps] / [Participants] has allowed to verify a high precision reliability of the generalization of the results. The operability of the observation system has been reflected in the regular behavior structures (T-patterns) detected -through the THEME software-, which have allowed characterizing difficulties in the assimilation of an incipient computational language related to the ability of spatial orientation and the sequencing capacity of children -situations involving turning and number of commands used in the sequence-. © 2021 Universidad de País Vasco

ABSTRACT: This study provides evidence about factors that facilitate the development of computational thinking (CT) in Costa Rican elementary school students, including the description of the contribution of the LIE++ proposal that addresses CT knowledge and practices through programming and physical computing projects. A quasi-experimental design was used to compare a group of students from the LIE++ educational proposal with a group of students from another proposal called LIE-Guides, which emphasizes learning with digital technologies. The study sample comprised 14,795 voluntary students, who answered an online test that was constructed and validated to estimate the scores achieved in CT. The results showed that the students participating in the LIE++ proposal obtained better scores compared to the LIE-Guides group. A multilevel regression model demonstrated that students’ personal and social variables, as well as the proposal’s execution scheme, positively affected student learning in CT. This research is a first approach to the subject in this context. It refers to the importance of providing educational opportunities that focus on more advanced computing knowledge and skills, as well as the relevance of continuing to develop tools and methodologies that help generate evidence about CT in education in order to improve educational interventions. © 2021.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this research revolves around a term that has become popular over the years and whose origins took place from the technical perspective of computer science in order to automate information or the production of systems. However, nowadays it is widely used by many professionals from several areas and groups that are interested in understanding and adopting a different way of thinking and assuming life situations. This concept is called Computational Thinking. This research pursues the objective of contributing to the construction of a definition on computational thinking, as well as to the use of this term for educational purposes. The research is descriptive with a documentary design, based on the review of literature related to the subject, in order to properly specify how computational thinking is seen as an option for the representation, acquisition of knowledge and attention to problems, from the viewpoint of experts as ISTE & CSTA (2011), Papert (1980), García-Peñalvo (2016), Wing (2006), among others. It was found that a definition by consensus of computational thinking has been the subject of constant debate within the scientific community, and one of the best options surrounding this kind of thinking is its incorporation into the mandatory school curriculum, from early stages or levels of the educational system, in order to enhance the children’s analytical skills through the application of computer principles. © 2021, Ibero-American Association for Distance Higher Education (AIESAD).

ABSTRACT: Computational thinking has become an ability increasingly important in contemporary society. Educational digital games that deal with algorithmic sequences and structures can have a key role in the development of such ability in basic education, bringing fun and increasing students' involvement. However, many games developed with this goal are not always intuitive enough to facilitate the development of children's computational thinking. Building on previous work, this paper reports the evaluation of three children's games of this type, with the aim of consolidating a set of guidelines for interface and interaction design to help developers of these games.

ABSTRACT: Objective. In this work, we analyze the type of difficulties and arguments that three-year-old children show when they carry out tasks related to programming and educational robotics. Method. A theoretical design has been developed, and a sequence of activities has been implemented in a classroom of 3-year-old children. A case study was conducted with 8 children. Results. Among the results, we identified three types of difficulties, those derived from the characteristics of the robot, those associated with the action-instruction comprehension dimension of computational thinking, and those associated with the cognitive stage of the children. Conclusions. Based on the analysis of the arguments expressed in the development of the task, we conclude that the use of educational robots at early ages favors the development of computer literacy, and this makes its inclusion in classroom activities recommendable. © 2022 Universidad Nacional.

ABSTRACT: The development of programming skills is currently promoting from an early school age, trying to get children to take an active and creative role in the use of technologies. The objective of this article is to verify the repercussion of educational robotics activities on kindergarten students in the acquisition of computational thinking and programming skills. The research design is quasi-experimental, with pre-test and post-test measures, using experimental and control groups. The sample consists of 131 students from the second cycle of early education (between 3 and 6 years old), all from the same Spanish school. Computational thinking is measured through three dimensions: sequences (algorithms), action-instruction correspondence and debugging. The intervention sessions, as well as the structure of the challenges that were used in the pre- and post-test evaluations, were designed based on the reference program of robotics studies called "TangibleK". The intervention, carried out doing learning activities using educational robotics resources, presents positive results in relation to the computational thinking skills achieved. The differences between the pre-test and the post-test in the experimental and control groups are statistically significant, in that children engaged in robotics program achieves a greater advance in the three dimensions of computational competence through this method. © 2019 Grupo Comunicar Ediciones.

El objetivo de este trabajo es comprobar la repercusión del desarrollo de actividades de robótica educativa en la adquisición de habilidades de pensamiento computacional y programación en escolares de educación infantil. El diseño de la investigación es de tipo cuasi-experimental, con medidas pretest y postest, utilizando grupo experimental y control. La muestra la conforman 131 estudiantes del segundo ciclo de educación infantil (entre 3 y 6 años de edad) de un centro educativo español. El pensamiento computacional se mide a través de tres dimensiones: secuencias (algoritmos), correspondencia acción-instrucción y depuración. Las sesiones de intervención, así como la estructura de los retos que se utilizaron en las evaluaciones pre y postest fueron diseñadas tomando como base el programa de estudios en robótica denominado «TangibleK». La intervención, centrada en actividades de aprendizaje mediante recursos de robótica educativa, presenta resultados positivos en relación a las habilidades de pensamiento computacional logradas. Las diferencias encontradas entre el pre y postest en el grupo experimental son estadísticamente significativas y superiores a las presentadas en el grupo control, de modo que se concluye que los niños que realizan el programa de robótica consiguen un mayor avance en las tres dimensiones de la competencia computacional. © 2019 Grupo Comunicar Ediciones.

ABSTRACT: This monographic issue of RED was convened with the title Education in Mathematics, Computational Thinking and STEM supported by digital technology. Its instructional design focus is the activation principle. In this article, the authors present the current issue, describe the activation principle as an important theoretical foundation of instructional design for computational thinking and mathematics and STEM Education, and introduce subsequent papers. There are numerous skills and concepts, specific to Computational Thinking, Mathematics and STEM, that are necessary as a basis for undergraduate studies. Often these concepts and procedures do not appear explicitly in the primary and secondary school curriuclum. Or, if they do appear, there is no guarantee students will have mastered them by graduation. We cannot expect these skills to appear spontaneously, at the very moment they are needed. A solid cognitive foundation is necessary for them to be activated. This special issue is presented with the aim of disseminating investigations and cases that partially or totally engage with these ideas. This can aid investigation of whether the effective use of the activation principle (Merrill, 2002; revised edition 2020), when used in an adequate instructional design, with methods, activites and resources, contributes to an improvement in the quality of learning results when what is learned in the previous stages is activated and reactivated sufficiently in undergraduate studies, and whether a pedagogy that establishes the value of these ideas and principles from the earliest educational stages should be promoted in order to prepare students for learning on the horizon, including STEM. © 2021 Universidad de Murcia.

ABSTRACT: Through our work to examine mathematical and computational learning in authentic and convivial contexts that requires creativity, imagination, reasoning, and discourse, we have theorized an experiential learning cycle that attends to the development of voice, agency, and identity needed in young people for an earned insurgency—the right to demand change. Our work underscores how the current situation that many students face in classrooms amounts to a type of cognitive segregation that denies these students access to authentic and empowering intellectual agency. By facilitating a process whereby students, using their own creative and imaginative means, intentionally develop a type of ownership over the exploration and application of the mathematical concepts they are being taught, we help students move from simple surface level, syntactic understandings, to deeper semantic learning that is more personally significant and meaningful. © 2023 CONICET - Emiliano Aldegani.

ABSTRACT: The way we access information has changed radically. The digital press, despite having a short history, has managed to consolidate itself in the communicative panorama, allowing society to be informed quickly, continuously and directly. The objective of this work is to discover and know the vision, as well as the benefits and disadvantages, that the main Spanish digital newspapers pour on educational robotics and computational thinking in early childhood and at home. In this research carried out with a qualitative methodology, under an ethnographic-narrative approach, the content of the news on this subject, published in the 20 main Spanish digital newspapers (natives and migrants) has been analyzed through the ATLAS.ti software., during the last 8 months. The main findings show that the insertion of educational robotics in all areas of life is increasing, presenting it as an effective resource to work in all areas, especially STEAM, from early childhood. Similarly, working on computational thinking facilitates the acquisition of skills for personal and professional development. These results show that it is a topic of social interest, although there is little information related to an adequate and effective methodology for the use of these resources with early childhood. © 2022 Research Group Education and Virtual Learning (GREAV).

ABSTRACT: Technology has transformed the social scenario by incorporating strategies, techniques and methods to obtain more significant educational processes. The main initiative promoted is the strengthening of skills and competencies in programming and computational thinking. This article evidences the effect of a training program on educational robotics on the acquisition of computational thinking and programming skills in young children. The research design is quasi-experimental, with pretest and post-test measures, with an experimental and control group. The sample of participants consists of 46 students of the first year of Primary Education, with age between 6 and 7 years, belonging to a Spanish educational centre. Computational thinking is measured through the dimensions: algorithmic thinking sequences, abstraction-patterns and debugging. The learning activities used in the intervention sessions were an adaptation of the training actions proposed in the robotics study program “TangibleK”. The results obtained in this study reveal positive effects concerning the performance achieved by the participants in the activities carried out. This indicates a significant effect on the strengthening of skills linked to computational thinking. The differences found between the pretest and post-test measures of the experimental group are statistically significant and superior to those presented by the control group. In this way, it was concluded that the participants of the training program in robotics and programming obtain a more significant advance in the three dimensions of the computational competence explored. © 2020 Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca.

ABSTRACT: Working on Computational Thinking in the school environment develops specific skills such as abstraction, algorithmic thinking, automation, among others. In this field, a growing research interest relates most educational proposals to the use of technologies. This paper analyses the development of Computational Thinking through unplugged activities in the field of Music. A total of 200 primary schoolchildren, aged 10-12 years old, from public schools participated in the study. Of these, 150 were allocated to the experimental group and 50 to the control group. Data were collected before and after the intervention. The Computational Thinking Test was used to measure computational thinking. Student’s t-test was used to compare possible differences between control and experimental groups. Repeated measures models were used to compare differences between pre- and post-intervention, in addition to considering moderation for different academic abilities, environment and ethno-cultural background. The results indicate that there are no mean differences at pre-test for any of the variables. After the intervention in the experimental group, the data indicate an increase in computational thinking in all students with different academic abilities, especially in the high ability group, and an outstanding development in students with learning difficulties, immigrants, and those from rural areas. The conclusions highlight the possibility of proposing educational strategies to develop computational thinking without using technology, and their effectiveness in groups with different psychosocial characteristics. © 2023 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

ABSTRACT: The idea of computational thinking unplugged refers to a set of activities that are developed to encourage children skills that can be recalled later, to promote computational thinking. These activities are designed to be included in the early stages of cognitive development (early childhood education, the first stage of primary education, games at home with parents and friends, etc.). The skills are designed so that they can be evoked in other stages. In secondary education, in technical training, in professional or even higher education. The activities are usually done without computers and mobile screens, with cards, cards, classroom games or playground games, mechanical toys, etc. In this paper, it is highlighted that there is a series of data, ideas and circumstances that make it possible now, and not before, that unplugged computational thinking is implemented. Finally, we describe activities, initiatives and experiences that are already being developed, and we make proposals for activities and their guides for preschool teachers and caregivers. © 2019 Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca.

ABSTRACT: The status of computational thinking as one of the most demanded skills explains why suggestions are currently being made to apply it within the educational context. This paper constitutes an attempt to analyze the scientific literature on the implementation of computational thinking in the field of education published in the most important Web of Science database collections. To achieve this, a systemic revision was made where attention was paid to four variables, namely: publication year; countries with more productions; the most productive authors in this field; and documentary sources with a higher number of publications. Added to this, we carried out a classification according to the types of documents and the research methods used, along with the educational stages under study and the programming language adopted. Publications are undoubtedly on an upward trend, Spain standing out as one of the most productive countries in this area. Likewise, evidence demonstrates not only that this field of study has been addressed using the two main research methods - quantitative and qualitative - but also that the emphasis has traditionally been placed on the primary education stage. © 2020 Universidad de Murcia.

ABSTRACT: The incorporation of Computational Thinking (CT) workshops in the high school level emerges as an effective strategy to awaken the interest of female students in university engineering careers, in pursuit of reducing the gender gap. The systematic introduction of these workshops in pedagogical programs, in discordance with social stereotypes that can reduce the motivation of young women to get involved with CT, increase their enthusiasm in approaching the proposed activities, and awaken and/or increase interest to learn more about engineering careers. The CT methodology allows you to develop critical and creative thinking, acquire technological skills and develop confidence and self-esteem. These skills are essential for success in any field, and can help women break gender stereotypes and spark early vocations for STEM careers and especially engineering. © 2024 Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions.

ABSTRACT: For years it has been suggested that computational thinking can favor learning in mathematics. Programs such as Computational Algebraic Systems have been used for this. However, these technologies have failed to attract enough attention to achieve the expected learning goals. Also, a negative perception of the students with respect to this subject still exists. This article proposes a conceptual framework to systematically study the use of SCRATCH as an alternative tool for the development of computational thinking to accelerate the learning of mathematics in first-year university students. The proposed approach and its evaluation are based on the Motivation and Social Cognitive Theories. In addition, guidelines for experimental studies that seek to support and/or refute the proposed conceptual framework are defined. The results of this work aim to have implications in the areas of education, psychology and information systems. © 2019, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

ABSTRACT: Introduction. Computational thinking is one of the categories that currently assess the quality of people’s preparedness for life, educational and professional activities in the modern world, saturated with information technologies and digital tools. Many issues related to university students’ computational thinking remain insufficiently studied as applied to general education. Aim. The present research aims to discuss the essence of the concept of “computational thinking” and, mainly, the composition of its structural elements, methods of their formation and assessment at the level of higher education; and to compare the requirements for university students’ computational thinking and digital competencies, which have similarities and differences. Methodology and research methods. The present review article has theoretical and applied aspects. Except for several fundamentally important works of general studies, which reveal the concept of “computational thinking”, the author analysed mainly review articles published in the past five years in order to identify and systematise modern solutions related to the purpose of the work. Results and scientific novelty. An analysis of the basic concepts associated with computational thinking showed that at the level of definitions, due to their certain abstractness, the computational thinking of university students does not have much specificity compared to the computational thinking of schoolchildren. This specificity is manifested at the level of the list of cognitive and non-cognitive skills associated with computational thinking, requirements for the level of their development and assessment methods. In computational thinking, cognitive skills include abstraction, decomposition, pattern recognition, algorithmisation, visualisation, logical thinking, communicative competence, the ability to present, structure and analyse data, and some others skills. Non-cognitive skills include self-confidence, communication skills, flexibility, and others. Methods for assessing the maturity of students’ computational thinking include the results of solving problems in block programming environments such as Scrath; knowledge/skill tests, self-assessment scales/surveys; tests on knowledge of the basics of computational thinking, interviews and observations; interviews, grades for assignments/courses, surveys/questionnaires, solving problems external to the class; the use of a special software environment, the use of criteria for assessing computational thinking and/or psychometric tools; assessments based on solving robotic problems or evaluating artifacts created during the game, and others. A comparison of computational thinking with digital competencies at the skill level leads to the conclusion that in computational thinking, skills represent a certain fixed set of meta-skills needed by a student regardless of solving specific problems (for example, abstraction skills). In digital competencies, skills are specified according to numerous types and are more specific. Practical significance. The results of this study can be used in the design of programmes for developing computational thinking and digital competencies of university students. © 2024 Russian State Vocational Pedagogical University.

ABSTRACT: As its first objective, this article carries out a bibliometric analysis aimed at serving as a guide on how to conduct bibliometrics using Biblioshiny, an interface of the Bibliometrix statistical software. To achieve this, a search has been used as an example, detailing the methodology, procedures, and strategies employed to address research questions and, as a secondary objective, to understand which works jointly develop Computational Thinking, Modelling, and Inquiry in the field of sciences. By utilizing quantitative statistical methods for data visualization, the intention is to identify the most relevant authors and journals, along with their impact indices, as well as the main thematic areas and their temporal evolution, in order to gain insights into what is being studied and how in this field. The results indicate that modelling is one of the salient themes among the 31 selected articles, accomplished through research, construction, and design of simulations in digital environments using block-based programming. © 2024 Universidad de Cadiz.

ABSTRACT: The development of computational thinking has become one of the educational priorities in several countries around the world. In this article, two experiences are described in which two block programming tools are used. The first experience only used BlocksCAD, while the second added the use of Blockly and the work on some mathematical algo-rithms in a maths classroom. The number of participants in the experience was twenty-eight in the group that only used Blocky and thirteen in the group that combined the use of both tools, all of them of the third year of secondary education (between 14 and 15 years old) in a school in Spain. The results show that, although the use of BlocksCAD alone al-lows an increase in the development of CT, if other resources such as Blockly are also used in the mathematics class-room, the effect is multiplied. In addition, considering the satisfaction results of the participants in the experience, to-gether with the possibility of printing their own creations through 3D modelling (a fact claimed by the students them-selves), this encourages us to continue using both tools and even to try to combine them with other tools and to design experiences that encompass entire academic courses or, at least, entire trimesters. © 2024, Universidad Internacional de la Rioja.

ABSTRACT: The term "computational thinking" emerged fifteen years ago and has become a world-wide popular tendency in the pre-university educational scope. Its looseness makes difficult to hold a debate on its curricular role, a lack which is especially severe in Spain. The article aims at contributing to clarify the meaning of "computational thinking" and its educational implications. We conducted a qualitative content analysis, using the definitions provided by a selection of outstanding authors and institutions as primary materials. Three aspects were analyzed: Definition, features and elements, and scope of knowledge. We have found two common components in the definitions analyzed: The reference to a "mental activity" and the inclusion of programming skills. However, they differ in the inclusion of other elements, which can be classified as knowledge, attitudes or competences. The article discusses the consequences of a definition based on a "mental activity" rather than educational constructs. We conclude that the debate on pre-university computing education should be based on a more precise terminology, as well as on the current body of knowledge in pedagogy, computing and didactics of computing. © 2021 Universidad de Murcia.

ABSTRACT: This article reports the development of reasoning and logic using Computational Thinking skills about content in Ecology, using as active strategy, contextualized practical activities for the Forest Engineering, Biology, Agronomic Engineering and Geography courses at the Regional University of Blumenau during the pandemic period of COVID-19. Computational thinking has been increasingly encouraged, not only for those who wish to become computer scientists, but also to develop other important skills that are used to solve problems, using a combination of critical thinking and fundamentals of computing. The research used was qualitative of the phenomenological type. In the analysis, the teachers involved concluded that to solve a problem, even if it is Ecology, it is not necessary to use a computer to process the algorithm to find the solution, a student can create an algorithm and process it and find the answer.  © 2021 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: The Development of Computational Thinking skills in elementary school students can be done through different activities, with or without the use of computers or technological devices. In this sense, the use of programmable robots brings many of the advantages of educational robotics for teaching fundamental aspects of computing. This paper describes an educational intervention that evaluates the use of four educational robot models to improve Computational Thinking with primary school students in the Huancavelica region in Peru, South America. This Peruvian region is known for its low human development rates, where the population still faces some important barriers regarding access to education and technology. The study was conducted with 6 to 13 years-old children for four weeks. Computational Thinking was evaluated using computational concepts like sequences, cycles, events, parallelism, conditionals, operators, and data manipulation. The evaluation results showed that children preferred robots that have more interaction, connectivity, and programming features, and they could contribute significantly to the development of Computational Thinking skills. © 2022 Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca.

ABSTRACT: Computational thinking is a fundamental ability that has acquired great relevance because it provides students with tools to manage information and develop analytical skills, which allows them to perform according to current society. Despite the importance of Computational thinking, one of the biggest barriers for teachers, when including it in their curriculum, is that they lack knowledge about how to evaluate it, keep track of each student’s progress and facilitate their learning according to the development of the ability. An assessment model which facilitates the evaluation of different criteria allowing teachers to estimate the development of this ability of its students is proposed. The proposed assessment model is established considering Evidence-centered assessment design, this framework allows constructing educational assessment considering evidence provided by students, in order to deliver a precise estimation of performance including information that is difficult to collect through conventional processes. © 2020, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

ABSTRACT: One of the challenges in engineering education is equipping our students with the skills to identify, formulate, and solve problems through a process of seeking the best answer. Computational thinking that is being incorporated into curricula worldwide, helps to improve analytical skills, involves solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behavior, based on the fundamentals of computing. Many of the ways that have been used to incorporate computational thinking are tied to programming courses in the first semesters, which can be challenging for students. Our work presents the experience of using the Lightbot game as a tool to incorporate the development of computational thinking as a support to the problem-solving competence in engineering. To validate our proposal, quantitative analysis with a quasi-experimental design was carried out with a convenience sample of 80 students. Three dimensions related to problem-solving have been evaluated: algorithmic thinking, decomposition, and generalization). The result obtained shows a significant difference in the three p-value results of the experimental group. Having made use of Lightbot has allowed us to observe that it can be incorporated in short sessions and courses aimed at solving problems and that they are not necessarily linked to programming, which would allow its incorporation in different subjects of the various Engineering programs. © 2021, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, there is an interest in developing practices, concepts and perspectives of computational thinking and programming in schools. Therefore, it is crucial to train teachers in these subjects. However, little is known about the process that teachers follow when approaching these new contents. In this context, the present exploratory and intrinsic case study aims to analyze the computational thinking practices developed by a group of 13 teachers while participating in a professional development workshop, where they created technologies for social inclusion (TIS) by programming with Scratch. The analysis of the different data collected during this pilot experience (surveys, productions carried out by the participants, audio recordings, etc.) evidences a close articulation between computational practices and programming of hypermedia projects that addresse participants’ contextualized problematics. These results show that professional development related to programming was proposed as a process close to the day-to-day reality of teachers, highlighting the importance of generating mediated and situated educational practices. Designing a training path to create TIS appears, in this sense, as a valid option for the teaching of programming and the development of computational thinking, in line with previous studies that proposed professional development courses for teachers from contextualized proposals, and using significant examples in a community and collaborative framework of reflection and exchange. © 2019 Universidad Nacional.

ABSTRACT: The development of Computational Thinking (CT) in school education is considered essential to enable students to solve complex problems by deploying skills such as pattern identification and algorithm design. This article describes the evaluation of a learning experience of PC components from the complex reasoning approach (R4C) using a web-based virtual reality (WebVR) application called Virtual Campus. The method was intrinsic to a single case with a sequential study design based on quantitative methods. Two instruments were applied to 176 university students, the first to measure the acceptance of the virtual environment and the second to assess the development of complex reasoning. The results indicate that the evaluation of the virtual campus and its tools is satisfactory, with very favorable evaluations in terms of ease and intention of use, likewise, the 3D learning experience allowed to scale mainly scientific and critical thinking skills. Due to the above, it can be affirmed that the PC-R4C-WebVR convergence will generate innovative learning dynamics, aligned with the demands of a constantly changing education and that contribute to the improvement of problem-solving practices. © 2023 Universidad de Murcia.

ABSTRACT: This document presents the results of the development of a learning program on computational thinking through programming challenges with robots oriented to early childhood. The methodological approach used was quantitative, using a quasi-experimental design, taking pretest/posttest measures, with experimental and control groups. The sample of participating students was 46. They belonged to a group of first grade of primary education, aged between 6 and 7 years, in a Spanish educational center. The learning of computational thinking was measured through the following dimensions: Algorithmic thinking-sequences, abstraction-patterns and debugging. The learning activities used were an adaptation of the activities proposed in the 'TangibleK' robotics curriculum. The results generated show positive effects in relation to the level of achievement reached by the students in the proposed challenges; in other words, there is a significant effect on the mastery of skills related to computational thinking. Differences were found between the pretest and posttest measures of the experimental group. Those of the latter group were statistically significant and higher than those of the control group. Therefore, we can statistically attribute the mastery of computational thinking skills to the participation in the training activities.  © 2022 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Background: The term computational thinking offers a new approach in the field of cognitive science, through the premise of systematizing the steps of problem solving that it can be applied in Artificial Intelligence and to other sciences. Objectives: Offer to participants a continuous training in the context of computational thinking and evaluate the impact of understanding these teachers about their respective concepts and practices. Design: Of a qualitative nature, involving specific dynamics of action-research, the design of the teaching experience involves the elaboration of tasks, used as a teaching hypothesis, subject to reassessments and readjustments. Settings and participants: In remote context, through the Teams platform, with eleven primary and higher schoolteachers from Brazil, Portugal, Cape Verde and Angola. Data collection and Analysis: Data obtained through the recordings of the meetings and the proposals of the participants, analyzed according to the four phases of the reflexive spiral and the expansive cycle. Results: The contributions and involvement of the teachers were significant, and some proposals of activities conceived, two of them presented in this article. Conclusions: With the partial results obtained it is expected that the insertion of computational thinking in basic education develops skills of different abstraction, which helps children in solving problems in all areas of life, not only in the use of computers or for future computer scientists. The participants' proposals will be published and made available online, to contribute to teacher training in the context of computational thinking. © 2021 Lutheran University of Brazil.

ABSTRACT: The importance of computational thinking in the development of thinking and learning mathematics is specified from the methods and techniques used to systematically and algorithmically solve operations that demand the automation of ordered and sequential knowledge, transferring each mechanism to the treatment of referring information. to instructions raised in the definition of real student problems. The purpose of the study is to analyze computational thinking versus mathematical thinking, showing that there is a correlation between them, through learning processes in high school students at 7th and 9th grade levels of the Manuel Elkin Patarroyo District Community Educational Institution in the city of Barranquilla, Colombia; In particular, similarities, analogies and similarities that are evidenced are presented, through the correlational analysis between both thoughts through the cognitive dimension of the learning processes. The study was developed using a quantitative methodology, non-experimental method, cross section and explanatory scope; allowing the questionnaire to obtain the information. The results show the coincidence between both thoughts, statistically proving the strong correlation between the variables. It is concluded that as learning processes develop in one thought, they are implicitly generated in the other. © Licencia de Creative Commons Atribución 4.0 Internacional (CC BY 4.0) https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.es

ABSTRACT: Traditionally the concept of ‘complexity’ is used as a synonym for ‘complex society’, i.e., human groups with characteristics such as urbanism, inequalities, and hierarchy. The introduction of Nonlinear Systems and Complex Adaptive Systems to the discipline of archaeology has nuanced this concept. This theoretical turn has led to the rise of modelling as a method of analysis of historical processes. This work has a twofold objective: to present the theoretical current characterized by generative thinking in archaeology and to present a concrete application of agent-based modelling to an archaeological problem: the dispersal of the first ceramic production in the western Mediterranean. © 2017 CSIC.

ABSTRACT: Computational thinking, commonly associated with engineering and computer science disciplines, can be analyzed in other areas, since this process exceeds the fostering of computing skills and encompasses critical, lateral and creative thinking processes. This article was based on the question: What are the differences in the dimensions of computational thinking among disciplinary areas of undergraduate students? We worked with a cross-sectional study design and convenience sampling, with a 29-item scale to evaluate computational thinking in 95 undergraduate students studying various disciplines in two Mexican universities. The results showed that there were differences with engineering students who have greater critical, algorithmic and problem-solving thinking. In cooperativity and creativity, no significant differences were found between psychology, administrative informatics and engineering students. This article is intended to be of value to researchers, academics, students and decision makers interested in creating scenarios that promote problem solving. © 2021 Red Universitaria de Campus Virtuales.

ABSTRACT: Digital games represent a ludic, attractive and pedagogically interesting possibility for teaching-learning processes. The appearance of several children's games based on creation of algorithmic sequences for controlling characters shows the growing importance given to the development of computational thinking at elementary level. However, the adoption of this kind of game in educational contexts is hindered by the lack of trustworthy design and evaluation methods to access the quality of the games and guide developers and educators. This paper reports the evaluation of a children's digital game for teaching computational thinking, and presents results that contribute to the generation of guidelines related to interface elements, interaction issues and key design choices for performing functions that are common to games of the kind. © 2015 Association for Computing Machinery.
